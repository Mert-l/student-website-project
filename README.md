The idea of this project is to create a social website for students to buy and resell things textbooks or furniture, and upload various posts,
like searching for a tutor or subletting their room. All in one place. Users can register with a new profile, log in, create/delete posts etc. Also to respond to a post with 
sending an email (not working atm). The website fetches all the posts created by users in the same city (and only that city, not ideal, will change it).
